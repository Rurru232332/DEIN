KORN - BLIND (Korn, 1994)

Are you ready?

This place inside my mind
A place I like to hide
You don't know the chances
What if I should die?
This place inside my brain
Another kind of pain
You don't know the chances
I'm so blind
Blind
Blind

Another place I hide
To scape the pain inside
You don't know the chances
What if I should die?
This place inside my brain
Another kind of pain
You don't know the chances
I'm so blind
Blind
Blind

Deeper and deeper and deeper
As I dream to live a life
That seems to be
A lost reality
That can never find a way
To reach my inner
Self-steem is low
How deep can I go?
In the ground that I lay
If I don't find a way to
See through the gray
That clouds my mind
This time I look to see
What's between lines

I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind!

I'm blind
I'm blind
I'm blind
I'm blind!
